# Project Name
> Outline a brief description of your project.
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
Create a dataset - Using tools like Google Colab/Drive
Visualize the data - SHow the Images a spart of DataSet
Create the model 1 - Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset
Create model 2 after adding Dropout Layer
Create Model 3 with Augmeneted Data
Train the model and Visualizing training results

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Model 1 has average accuracy and overfitting
Model 2 has reduced validation accuracy
Model 3 has Highest Train and Validation accuracy
